# Todo Application

This is a simple TODO application created using the latest technologies - Swift, SwiftUI, and either Swift Data or CoreData. The application provides the following features:

- **Listing all TODO items:** View all the TODO items in a list format.
- **Filtering TODO items:** Filter the items based on their state (Done or Open).
- **Sorting by due date:** Sort the TODO items based on their due date.
- **Item detail view:** View detailed information about a selected item.
- **Item edit view:** Edit the properties of a TODO item.
- **Item delete with confirmation:** Delete a TODO item with a confirmation prompt.

To successfully complete the TODO application assignment, follow these steps:

1. Set up a new Swift project using SwiftUI as the user interface framework.
2. Define a data model for the TODO item, including the required properties: title, description, state, and due date.
3. Implement the functionality to list all TODO items by creating a view that fetches and displays the items from a data source (e.g., an array or a database).
4. Add filtering capabilities to the TODO list by implementing controls (e.g., buttons or segmented controls) to filter items based on their state (Done or Open).
5. Implement sorting functionality by allowing users to sort the TODO list based on the due date property.
6. Create a detail view that shows the details of a selected item, displaying all the item properties. Provide options to edit or delete the item from this view.
7. Implement an edit view that allows users to modify the properties of a TODO item. Make sure this view is accessible from both the detail view and the list view.
8. Add delete functionality with confirmation to both the list view and the detail view. Prompt the user for confirmation before removing the item from the list.
9. Thoroughly test the application to ensure that all the features and functionalities work as intended.
10. Document your code, including clear comments and explanations for different parts of the application.
11. Package the application for delivery, following any submission guidelines provided.
